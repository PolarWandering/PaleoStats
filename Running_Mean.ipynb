Since we are just going to consider points in the sphere, we will mostly use the geodesic length as distance between points in the sphere, also know as Great-circle or Haversine distance when points are specified by their latitude and longitude:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous example we just consider the case where $t_i$ is known. However, in practice we may want to include a confidence interval for the time variable or measure of uncertaty. For this case, we need to assume some probabilistic model about how the data was generated. One way of doing this is assuming that times are samples from a probabilistic distribition, $t_i \\sim T_i$ independent, and then we want to minimize \n",
